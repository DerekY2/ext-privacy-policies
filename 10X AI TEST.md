# 10X AI TEST - Privacy Policy

## Intro

"10X AI", "10X AI TEST" refers to [10X-AI](https://dereky2.github.io/10X-AI/), as well as any of its derivatives. Different apps use personal data in different ways. This privacy policy encompasses and explains general principles of how I ("we","10X AI", "10X AI TEST") collect and handle personal data.

You'll notice that my privacy policies tend to lack "professionalism". That's just because I doubt anyone actually reads them, so I'm doing my best to keep it short and concise.


## Data Collection

**I do not share any data with third parties under any circumstances**.

**I keep logs of all chats generated through 10X AI TEST**. This data is used solely for keeping track of errors and anomalies in order to improve the app. **None of this data is shared elsewhere**. 


No personally-identifiable data is collected. As such, logged data cannot be traced back to its original user.
