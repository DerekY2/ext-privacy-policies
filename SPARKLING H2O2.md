# Sparkling H2O2 - Privacy Policy

## Intro

"Sparkling H2O2" refers to [Sparkling H2O2](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sparkling-h2o2/dolaidlinopdijhbmholdeilalbedhjm), as well as any of its derivatives such as [Timetable Tools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/timetable-tools/kodbkfefblmoancdclenijdghigiapgn). Different extensions use personal data in different ways. This privacy policy encompasses and explains general principles of how I ("we","Sparkling H2O2") collect and handle personal data.

You'll notice that my privacy policies tend to lack "professionalism". That's just because I doubt anyone actually reads them, so I'm doing my best to keep it short and concise.


## Data Collection

**I do not share any data with third parties under any circumstances**.

**I keep logs of every calendar generated through Sparkling H2O2: Timetable Tools**. This data is used solely for keeping track of errors and anomalies that may occur while generating timetables, in order to improve the functionality and performance of the extension.


## Chrome Storage API

Sparkling H2O2 takes advantage of [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/storage) to locally store minimal state information. This is similar to a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies). Examples of data stored this way include any settings, customizable components, and changes made through the extension. Google may sync this information across your various computers and Chrome installations. **None of this data is shared elsewhere**.
